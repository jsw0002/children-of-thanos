      Welcome to Children of Thanos.
      This is a 10-team league that was formed in 2018.
      The league will be run on <a target="_blank" href="https://sleeper.app/">sleeper.app</a>.
      All owners are expected to pay their league fee before the draft begins.
      If you do not plan to participate in the league the following season let me know at least one month prior to the draft so I can find a replacement.
      This league is designed to be a competition between owners, but it not a cut-throat league where anything goes.
      The rules described in this section are designed to act as a guideline for overall league play, and any disputes will be handled by the commissioner of the league.
      Please remember that the overall goal of this league is to have fun and enjoy the game of football. If you have any question or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.

    <sub-section title="Commissioner Information">
      The commissioner for Children Of Thanos for 2018 is Jordan Willis.
      I can be contacted through league chat, email <a href="mailto:jsw0002@gmail.com">(jsw0002@gmail.com)</a>, or cell <a href="tel:1-317-496-4739">(317.496.4739)</a>.
      I do this for the love of football and fantasy.
      I will be responsible for resolving all disputes that are not expressly covered by this constitution.
      While all owners are encouraged to submit suggestions to the commissioner, the commissioner's decision on all matters is final.

    <sub-section title="Living Constitution">
      It is important to note that this is a living, breathing constitution that will change and evolve over the lifetime of this league.
      Changes will happen between seasons as often as possible and will be effective from that point moving forward.
      If you have suggestions for changes, please submit them to the commissioner by any of the available contact methods.
